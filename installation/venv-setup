# Install other packages and development tool for a robust programming environment.

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Make sirectory where you want to create your environment. For instance:

mkdir environment
cd environment/

# Once you are in the directory, create virtual environment by running following command: 

pyvenv virtenv

# pyvenv sets up a new directory that contains a few items which we can view with the ls command, having files such as bin, include, lib, lib64, pyvenv.cfg, share.




#FOR MAC OS:

#I install virtualenv in the home directory and have my requirements.txt file created in 
#its subdirectory, which lets me activate the virtual environment for any project dir
#in my system. This avoids installing/creating virtualenv everytime I want to work on
#projects

#Check for pip package on your system
1. pip --version

2. sudo easy_install pip or pip install --upgrade pip (if you don't have it)

#Test your installation
3. pip install numpy 
 
#TIP: pip search <module_name>, will show you all the related packages.
4. pip install virtualenv

#You are now setting up a virtual environment for the project.
#This will also create a subdirectory named "venv".
#You can choose whatever meaningful name your want.
5. virtualenv virtual-env

#Requirements file lets you pin down packages with/without versions, you want your
#environment to have installed before running your script.
6. vim requirements.txt

7. cd <directory where you have your project>

#Activate your vritual environment now. 
8. source ~/virtual-env/bin/activate

#Strongly recommended to run the requirement.txt file before running your script.
#Be mindful of the name of the file. 
9. pip install -r ~/virtual-env/requirements.txt

#You can/should deactivate your virtual enviorment when done.
10. deactivate
